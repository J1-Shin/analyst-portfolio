# Healthcare No-show Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Medical Appointment No-shows** dataset from Brazil (`KaggleV2-May-2016.csv`).  
The goal is to explore patient appointment data, identify factors that influence no-show rates,  
and provide operational insights for improving scheduling efficiency.

- **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Medical Appointment No Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)  
- **Key variables**:
  - `ScheduledDay`: The date when the appointment was booked
  - `AppointmentDay`: The actual appointment date
  - `No-show`: Whether the patient attended (`No`) or missed (`Yes`)
  - Other demographic and health-related variables: `Age`, `Gender`, `Scholarship`, `SMS_received`, etc.

## üîë Key Takeaways (TL;DR)
- **Weekday Effect**: No-shows spike on certain weekdays (e.g., Monday/Friday)  
- **Lead Time Effect**: Longer scheduling gaps ‚Üí higher no-show risk  
- **Demographics**: Young adults (19‚Äì30) most likely to miss appointments; seniors least likely  
- **SMS Reminders**: Alone, not effective ‚Äî likely targeted at high-risk groups

## üóÇÔ∏è Analysis Steps

### 1. No-show by Weekday (`01_eda.ipynb`)
- Converted `AppointmentDay` into weekdays (Mon‚ÄìSun)
- Aggregated **total appointments, number of no-shows, and no-show rate**
- Visualized weekday-level no-show rate with bar chart

**Artifacts**
- `data/processed/weekday_noshow_summary.csv`
- `assets/no_show_rate_by_weekday.png`

**Preview**
![](assets/no_show_rate_by_weekday.png)

**Key Insight**
- No-show rates vary across weekdays (e.g., higher on certain weekdays such as Monday/Friday)  
- This suggests possible links with weekend/holiday patterns ‚Üí **tailored reminder strategies per weekday**

---

### 2. No-show by Lead Time (`02_leadtime_analysis.ipynb`)
- Calculated `LeadTime = AppointmentDay - ScheduledDay`
- Cleaned data:
  - Removed negative/invalid values
  - Capped extreme values (>60 days) to stabilize distribution
- Grouped lead time into buckets:
  - `0d`, `1‚Äì2d`, `3‚Äì5d`, `6‚Äì10d`, `11‚Äì20d`, `21‚Äì30d`, `31‚Äì60d`
- Aggregated no-show statistics and visualized

**Artifacts**
- `data/processed/leadtime_noshow_summary.csv`
- `assets/no_show_rate_by_leadtime.png`

**Preview**
![](assets/no_show_rate_by_leadtime.png)

**Key Insight**
- **Shorter lead times are associated with lower no-show rates**, while longer lead times significantly increase the risk of no-shows.  
- Example: Same-day (`0d`) appointments show the lowest no-show rate, whereas 21+ day lead times show noticeably higher rates.  
- **Actionable Suggestion**: Increase reminder frequency for long-lead-time patients; consider slight overbooking for this segment.

### 3. No-show by Demographics (`03_demographic_analysis.ipynb`)
- Created **age groups**: Child (0‚Äì12), Teen (13‚Äì18), Young Adult (19‚Äì30), Adult (31‚Äì45), Middle Age (46‚Äì60), Senior (60+)
- Grouped by **AgeGroup √ó Gender**
- Aggregated appointments, no-shows, and no-show rate
- Visualized both line chart and grouped bar chart

**Artifacts**
- `data/processed/demographic_noshow_summary.csv`
- `assets/no_show_rate_by_age_gender.png`
- `assets/no_show_rate_by_age_gender_bar.png`

**Preview**

**Key Insight**
- **Teens (13‚Äì18) and Young Adults (19‚Äì30)** show the **highest no-show rates**.  
- Seniors (60+) show the **lowest no-show rate**.  
- Gender differences exist but are relatively small; males sometimes show slightly higher no-show rates.  
- **Action Suggestion**: For younger groups (19‚Äì30), targeted digital reminders or flexible scheduling could reduce no-shows.

### 4. SMS Reminder Effect (`04_sms_analysis.ipynb`)

We analyzed whether receiving an SMS reminder influences the no-show rate.

#### 4.1 Overall Effect
- Grouped by SMS_received (0 = No SMS, 1 = SMS Sent)
- Compared overall appointment volume, no-shows, and no-show rate

**Artifacts**
- `data/processed/sms_noshow_summary.csv`
- `assets/no_show_rate_by_sms.png`

**Preview**
![](assets/no_show_rate_by_sms.png)

**Key Insight**
- Patients who **received an SMS had a *higher* no-show rate (27.6%) compared to those who did not receive one (16.7%)**.  
- This counter-intuitive result suggests that SMS reminders may have been targeted toward patients already considered at higher risk of no-shows.  
- **Action Suggestion**: SMS alone may not be sufficient; consider multi-channel reminders (e.g., phone calls, mobile app push).

---

#### 4.2 SMS Effect by Age Group
- Grouped by AgeGroup √ó SMS_received
- Compared how SMS impacted no-show rates across different demographics

**Artifacts**
- `data/processed/age_sms_summary.csv`
- `assets/no_show_rate_by_age_sms.png`

**Preview**
![](assets/no_show_rate_by_age_sms.png)

**Key Insight**
- SMS reminders were **more frequently sent to younger groups** (e.g., Young Adults 19‚Äì30), who also naturally exhibit higher no-show rates.  
- Seniors (60+) showed low no-show rates regardless of SMS.  
- This indicates a **selection bias**: SMS was not randomly assigned but likely targeted at groups with historically higher no-show risk.  
- **Action Suggestion**: Instead of blanket SMS campaigns, hospitals could benefit from **age-tailored reminder strategies** (e.g., stronger digital reminders for young adults, phone call follow-ups for middle-aged groups).

## üìä Next Steps
1. **Interaction Analysis**
   - Combine variables (e.g., Weekday √ó Lead Time, Age √ó SMS) to identify compounding risk factors  

2. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression or Random Forest to estimate patient-level no-show probability  

3. **Cost Impact Simulation**
   - Estimate how many staff hours / costs could be saved by reducing no-shows by X%  

4. **Operational Dashboard**
   - Build a simple dashboard (e.g., Streamlit) so hospital staff can interact with findings
